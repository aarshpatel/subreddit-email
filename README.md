### What does it do
Subreddit-email is a simple script that I created that emails a user the top links of their favorite subreddits without having to go into reddit and open up different tabs for each subreddit. The email contains the top 10 submissions of your favorite subreddit with links to the original submission. 



I also created a workflow for the [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) app on Mac, so that I can run the script through throught that, which makes it even easier because I don't need to go into the terminal and run my python script everything I want to see the top links in my favorite subreddit.
